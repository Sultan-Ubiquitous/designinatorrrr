## Github
1. ~~Get repo details from github~~
2. ~~Get list of all files in the repo~~
3. ~~Vett out porper frontend files, aka ignore all backend files or anything related to backend.~~
4. How do I go about feeding this files to the agent to gain the file context?
   First think what decisions the AI needs to make when going about generating frontend componenets?
    So I need to make sure about
            css structuring(border radius margin padding etc)
            color scheme(what color goes where)
            Typography but only for large pages and not functional components
                                _Push it to later_
5. Take files and store it in a database, first just store names and only store needed files
